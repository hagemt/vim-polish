INTRODUCTION                                    *polish*

Let's try integrating marks with tasks. What does that mean?
Well, if you've just make a change, add a numbered mark.
That mark has a label, describing the task you just performed.
When you commit, there they are! It's like TODIDs for DCVS!

This should let you worry about the important stuff.
Especially when you're busy "polishing" something.
